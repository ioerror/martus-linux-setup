martus-linux-setup
==================

I wanted to use Martus on Ubuntu and to use the HippieJVM rather than the
Oracle nightmare. This package runs Martus with the
<code>java-1.6.0-openjdk</code> JVM and should allow the entire software stack
to be entirely comprised of Free Software.

All software in client-release/ is covered under the respective licenses of the
Martus software releases as detailed on their website:

  https://www.martus.org/

Martus is software released by Benetech:

This collection of scripts is Free Software as detailed in the LICENSE file.

==================

For the extremely lazy or time limited people, download this package by
visiting this url:

 https://github.com/ioerror/martus-linux-setup/zipball/master

Then get started and running like so:

<pre>
<code>
 unzip ioerror-martus-linux-setup-*.zip
 cd ioerror-martus-linux-setup*/

</pre>

==================

Install the required packages on Ubuntu:

<code>
